# Project requirements

Here we list the requirements that all submitted projects should meet. Functional requirements define the scope of the projects. Implementation details make sure all projects can be graded in the same way, and ensure usefulness for a broad audience.

## Functional requirements

* The project should answer a clearly defined question, or help readers answer those questions, using a notebook that  
   * describes the workflow (from raw data to data that can be visualized)
   * describes the visualization itself 
   * and answers the research question. 
* You are invited to work on the basis of one or more data sets that you haven’t used in earlier courses, as long as these allow a visualization of sufficient complexity to be created (pending approval by the course’s instructor).
* The final product must include at least one interactive component that is connected to the data (e.g. resulting in variable or dataset change).

## Implementation details

* The notebook should explain the data processing pipeline of your project from start to end. Make sure to include the following:
    * Brief introduction to the problem/research question
    * Description of your data set(s)
    * Description of the transformations applied to this data set
    * The visualization 
    * A description of the visualization. The visualization and description need to tell a story. The story should be reasonably original with regards to visualizations that have previously been published.
* During the project, keep track of a process book in which you describe your progress and challenges.
* Don't write all your code in the final notebook. Write your code in several python files (for loading the data, for the transformation etc.) and import your functions into the notebook. If you don't remember how to do this, refer back to the [explanation about packages](https://sp2.mprog.nl/news/packages).
* Someone who is not familiar with your project should be able to fully understand the pipeline of your project, without having to read all your code. 
* Add a readme file that describes all files in your folder (what does every file do and how to run them, including how to start your visualization)
* Under no circumstances should we be able to cause your program to crash at runtime.
* You must include your name in a comment atop every source file in the project.

## Submission

Hand in a zip file that includes 

0. Your orignal proof of concept, that includes what you then thought the MVP would be
1. The final notebook and all python files 
2. The raw data you started your project with and any intermediate processed versions, which should be clearly labeled. In case your data set is so large that handing it in becomes problematic, send an email to your TA to set up a different way to send the files.
3. A readme file with all information needed to run your code (what every file does, in what order to execute your code etc.)
4. Your process book
