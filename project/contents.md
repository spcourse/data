# Project

In this project, you'll create your own visualization with a data set and research question of your choice. The project is divided in four parts, shown below.

[Kickoff phase](/project/kickoff)

* Part 1: Proposal - Proof of concept

[Implementing your project](/project/implementation)

* Part 2: Design
* Part 3: Minimum Viable Product
* Part 4: Cleanup, Final Product

## Schedule

Underneath, the schedules for different starting periods are given. At the end of each part of the product, you'll discuss your progress with your TA via zoom. 

After part 1, you have to email a text file which includes your proof of concept.
After part 4, there will be a small presentation about your end product, and you have to hand in a zip file that includes all your code, data, a ReadMe and your decision journal.

## Process book

At the start of the project, create a process book in which you keep track of your progress during the project. Note that it is not necessary to describe in detail what you have been working on every day. Just describe your most important findings and challenges during the project. At the end of the project this process book gives an insight in the progression of the project from beginning to end. On [this website](https://blog.trello.com/decision-journal) you can find a nice and detailed overview on how to journal your projects. Below we provide you a distilled version of this information.

In your process book, you simply write down your decisions. When faced with a large decision, use your process book to document the following:

* The choice you've made
* What you expect to happen as a result of that choice
* Why you expect things to pan out that way

By doing so, you can use your process book for reflection. By documenting and reviewing your decisions frequently, you'll get a better grasp on the overall project.

### Some tips for your process book

Below you'll find some tips you’ll want to keep in mind.

1. **Don't use it for everything** Don't spend too much time on your progress book! Reserve it exclusively for the larger decisions that have potentially major consequences and require some serious thought and deliberation. Do not write down every small decision in your progress book.
2. **Keep it simple** Use simple language, short sentences, and be as straightforward as possible when documenting your decisions. That will allow you to look back and get the information you really need—without wading through paragraphs of flowery language and unnecessary details.  
3. **Create a simple template** In order to organize your process book, it is nice to create and use a template to write down your decisions. This will save you time when you face a larger decision you would like to write down. Here’s what this could look like:

    * Date I made this decision:
    * The decision I made was:
    * I believe this decision will lead to:
    * Why I believe this decision will pan out this way:
4. **Review your journal frequently** A process book isn’t about helping you make choices in the heat of the moment. It’s a record that you can refer back to in order to understand your blind spots and make better decisions moving forward. So, that means you need to actually look back at it—and you should plan to do so frequently.

## Scheduling meetings

If you would like to schedule a zoom meeting, send an email to your TA to make an appointment. Before every zoom meeting, email your process book to your TA (preferably some hours before the meeting).
