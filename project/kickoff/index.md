## Part 1: Proposal - proof of concept

First have a look at the [requirements](/project/requirements) of the project.

In this part you'll:

1. Acquire a data set and corresponding research question. 
2. Create a proof of concept

The first step in creating your visualization is thinking about what you would like to show. In order to do so, you'll first have to find a data set. Second, you'll have to decide on a research question that can be answered with the data you've found. Estimate the effort required to implement the project. Your project may have a high risk of failure if:

* the envisioned project tries to do too much
* the envisioned project doesn't do enough
* the purpose of the project is not well-defined (too vague)

Also think about the problem you are trying to solve, and how to capture this problem in a research question. The problem has to be clearly described and very specific. There are two possibilities here:

* There is a clearly defined problem that a reasonably large group of people have, which an app or visualization can solve particularly well.
* There is a widespread lack of knowledge or understanding that an interactive visualization is particularly suited to remedy.

The next step is to create a proof of concept. You do some explorative analysis on your data set to check if the data contains the information you need and also if you can find something interesting in the data. Are you able to find a pattern in your data that might answer your research question? 

In case you are not able to find something interesting or find out that your data, for example, is too incomplete, go back to step 1 and try to find a new data set and research question. Note that it is normal to iterate through step 1 and 2 a couple of times before you're able to find something interesing.

During this process, schedule a zoom meeting with your TA every time you have completed step 1 or step 2 of this part (whether or not succesfully). These meetings are intended to discuss your ideas, get feedback from your TA and approve your project concept. As it is expected that you will have to try several versions before you end up with a working proof of concept, make sure to schedule your first step 1 meeting as soon as possible. You can do this by making an appointment through email or coming by the lab sessions. It is helpful when you email us your Proof of Concept first.
