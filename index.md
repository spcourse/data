# Data Processing

## Syllabus

In this course you'll build your own toolkit of useful programs with which you can read, transform and analyze data that you might find in various scientific areas. You'll gain experience with professional development by implementing a final project for which you'll define a problem based on a public dataset, design a visual data interface and implement a data pipeline to bring everything together.

## Staff

Teachers: Iris Luden, Milena Kapralova

Coordinator: Simon Pauw

## Goals

In this course you'll build your own toolkit of useful programs with which you can read, transform and analyse data that you might find in various scientific areas. After this course we envision that you:

- you can read data into your programs from several structured standard formats
- you can transform data into a form suitable for further analysis by combining basic operators
- you can build meaningful visualizations of your data
- you understand how to write programs that are easy to understand for yourself and other programmers
- you are aware of the many tools that can help you with version management, correctness testing and performing code reviews

## Prerequisites

This course assumes that you finished the courses Scientific Programming 1 and 2.

Other than that, some modules assume high school mathematics or physics, but many do not. If you feel overwhelmed, don't hesitate to contact the course staff! We can explain the course's philosophy and requirements, and make recommendations on how to approach problems.
